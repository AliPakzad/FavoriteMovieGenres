# Favorite Movie Genres
## Programming Practice: Survey of Favorite Genres

In a survey, moviegoers were asked to list 3 of their favorite genres. They are given 6 different genres to choose from, including:

Horror, Romance, Comedy, History, Adventure, Action

Write a program that takes the number of people, then takes the name of each person with their favorite genres and prints the name of each genre and the number of people interested in that genre in the order of the most popular in the output. (If the level of interest in different genres is the same, print in the order of the English alphabet in the output.) If a genre is not selected, consider its value as zero and print the name and number 0 in the output.

Example input:
```
4  
hossein Horror Romance Comedy  
mohsen Horror Action Comedy  
mina Adventure Action History  
sajjad Romance History Action
```
Example output:
```
Action  : 3  
Comedy : 2  
History : 2  
Horror : 2  
Romance : 2  
Adventure : 1
```
